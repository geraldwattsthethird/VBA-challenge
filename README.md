Stock Market Data

## Background

A VBA script was utilized to calculate stock market data for 3 years using a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. The script tested and calculated the ticker letter, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. Yearly change was color coded with green for positive numbers and red for negative numbers.

Screenshots of each year's results as well as the VBA code can be found in the VBA-challenge folder.
